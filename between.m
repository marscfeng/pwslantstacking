function indicies = between(x1,x2,testpts,flag)
% BETWEEN: logical test, finds sampls in vector between given bounds
%
% indicies = between(x1,x2,testpts,flag)
% indicies = between(x1,x2,testpts)
%
% returns the indicies of those points in the array testpts which lie between
% the points x1 and x2. If no testpts are found between x1 and x2 then a
% single scalar 0 (false) is returned. Flag determines the exact nature of
% the inclusion of the endpoints:
%    if flag == 0, then not endpoints are included
%    if flag == 1, then x1 is included. i.e. if a test point is precisely
%                  equal to x1,	it will be considered "between"
%    if flag == 2, then both x1 and x2 are included
%    if flag == -2, then outside x1-x2 without x1/x2 included
%  ******** flag defaults to 0 ****
%
% Function works regardless of whether x1 < x2 or x2 < x1.
